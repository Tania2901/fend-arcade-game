# Classic arcade game clone

## You have to cross the roads and reach the water. Once a bug gets you - you lose .

## Instructions

* You can use the arrow keys to move.
* Your goal is to reach the water .

## How it's made?


The code is from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. I used HTML, CSS, JS to change the app.js, style.css and index.html files to:

* manipulate the DOM;
* create the classes, the new objects and add their methods


## Good luck and have fun!!!
